# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

[Unreleased]
- Ability to name journal file on first run.

## [0.1.7] - 2020-01-16
- Fixed the way some strings were put together.
- Cleaned up the code a little, and made things appear a little prettier. Less spaces, and `+`'s.
- Fixed some commenting.
- Removed 'site' since it's not up anymore.
- Condesed the code just a little.

## [0.1.5] - 2020-01-10
- Removed `import subprocess`. I forgot it was in there.
- Removed `journ-upgrade`. Seemed more like a waste than anything to me.
- Cleaned up `class App` because it had left over me in it.

I think this will probably be it. At least for awhile. Unless I end up trying to simplify and minimize it some more.

## [0.1.4] - 2020-01-09
- Removed extra code that wasn't really needed to achieve journ's function at the moment.
- Tried to organize the code, and make it a little nicer and smaller.
- Added the command `journ-upgrade`. It will check for updates, and apply them if available using pip. Just 'cause.
- Added a fun little command for myself. Shhh...
- Stopped being so full of myself...

## [0.1.0] - 2020-01-08
### Added
- Original Source for journ
- README contains description, and install instructions
- Created a 'landing page' for journ. Currently found at:
	https://ronbecker.github.io/journ
